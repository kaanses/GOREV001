                        50 major music tech brands sign Principles for Music Creation with AI</h2>

                    Over fifty global music technology companies and associations 
                    have penned their support for Roland and UMG’s Principles for Music Creation 
                    with AI. Per the principles, the participating companies advocate for the responsible
                    use of AI in music creation, to “protect the essence of music — its human spirit”.

                    BandLab Technologies, Splice, Beatport, Focusrite, Output, LANDR, Waves, Eventide, 
                    Native Instruments, NAMM, Sequential, Oberheim and more have united in a bid to protect 
                    the rights of musicians as the industry sees an acceleration of generative AI tech.The guidelines were 
                    established to encourage key figures in the music technology space to be mindful of the potential risks of AI.
                    In a statement, AIformusic says that it’s crucial to responsibly manage the impact of machine learning 
                    tools and adhere to the Principles to ensure that the music industry is protecting the integrity of artists.
                    Still, it adds, it acknowledges that AI can be an empowering tool for musicians and creators when applied 
                    with caution. Read more...

                </a>
                <p class="tm-pt-30">
                    In the gritty streets of Los Santos, where virtual gangsters roam and digital drive-bys reign 
                    supreme, Rockstar Games apparently decided that fake thugs just wouldn’t cut it for Grand Theft 
                    Auto: San Andreas. In a surprising revelation, former Rockstar developer Lazlow Jones revealed
                    that real-life gang members were actually recruited to record voiceovers for certain characters in 
                    the game.“One of the things that I’m really proud of is the level of authenticity that we would go for,” 
                    Jones says in an interview with Kinda Funny Games. He adds that the company would regularly fly out to record 
                    people with the accents they needed, saying: “If you need specific accents or languages, we’d travel to those
                    places.” Read more...

                        audio interface” ever made?</h2>
                </a>
                <p class="tm-pt-30">
                    If you’re just getting started with your studio setup, the last thing you need is equipment with 
                    a load of functions you don’t know how to use. Thankfully, Lewitt says its new Connect 2 audio 
                    interface is the “most user-friendly audio interface” ever made — that should make things pretty 
                    simple, right? Lewitt’s first venture into the world of audio interfaces, the Connect 6, was aimed 
                    squarely at content creators and streamers. Its blend of input and internal loopback options makes 
                    it a perfect match for small-scale video and broadcast production. It can make a decent fist of 
                    working in a music studio too, but doing so will waste some of the unit’s talents.

                    A cursory web search of ‘demoscene’ will lead you down one of cyberspace’s most 
                    esoteric rabbit holes. You’ll find website designs straight out of 1998, archives of 
                    trippy electronic music from 1999, and bizarre CGI music videos from competitions held
                    in 2000. This all transpired from a late-90s/early-00s online movement, the demoscene,
                    which saw creatives exploring the early internet. They’d pirate software, share music files,
                    build video games, and socialise in IRC chatrooms, forming a unique subculture.
                    Running in parallel to the demoscene was an even more niche movement: the tracker scene.
                    Here, music producers used software-based trackers — Aphex Twin, Calvin Harris and Venetian 
                    Snares are notable users of these early DAWs — to create electronic music on their home computers,
                    complete with CRT screens. Producers would then head to the web to share their music,
                    samples and video game scores with other tracker producers and demoscene fans.

                        creative sound design</h2>
                </a>
                <p class="tm-pt-30">
                    The music production world is awash with mix correction plugins, 
                    with many using ground-breaking AI that can take a less-than-stellar 
                    vocal recording from dud to ‘dude!’ with the click of a button. Elsewhere,
                    de-reverb and stem separation software can pull active sonic elements 
                    from a finished track. However, have you ever wondered if they could be 
                    used in less corrective and more creative ways? Long answer short: they 
                    sure can.You can use a variety of correction plugins as part of the sound design
                    process. While many will yield crunchy and funky lo-fi artefacts, others can elicit
                    unexpected — and extremely useful — results.
                    This tutorial heads into experimental territory 
                    so be sure to don your cleanest lab coat. You may want to have a 
                    few beakers of your favourite spirits on hand as well to encourage 
                    out-of-the-box thinking. And don’t worry: if you make a mess, just fix it with the
                    same plugin! Read more...
